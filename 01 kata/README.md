# Kata

There are katas in different sizes. In this repository I will only deal with the 3 smallest forms. 

The 3 more extensive categories "Application Kata", "Architecture Kata" and "Agility Kata" have problems with their size that distract from writing tests and the corresponding code. In addition, even in a team the duration of the exercise becomes too long for most users. Due to their size, these katas are often more of an exercise for architects and business analysts.

The 3 consider kata forms are ordered by size:

1. Function Kata: A Function Kata is a small task whose problem is an algorithm. The solution consists mostly of a single function.
2. Class Kata: The solution consists of a class with several thematically related functions. Often it concerns a described data type and several operations that can be applied to it.
3. Library Kata: Here the solution consists of several classes that can be combined in a library. The technical scope of these katas can already represent entire applications.
